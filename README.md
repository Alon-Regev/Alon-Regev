### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Alon Regev, and I like working on projects in my free time!

I especially like programming in Assembly, C and C++.

Another cool repository on GitLab I made (with a partner) while studying in "Magshimim": <br/>[TOR Project](https://gitlab.com/AlonRegev/emek-izrael-302-tor) - Trying to make a TOR Network including Hidden Services, Bridge Nodes and many cool Features!
